Immunotherapy (IO) is an approach to cancer treatment that uses a person's own immune system to fight diseases. Colorectal cancer (CRC) had been resistant to IO until recent research identified a subgroup of patients (MSI-H) who were receptive to certain IO treatments in a clinical trial. Now, clinical trials are investigating immunotherapy options for patients with Microsatellite Stable (MSS) tumors.

There are varying reasons why some trials have exclusion criteria for patients who have had certain types of treatment, including immunotherapy. However new trial designs are allowing more patients who've had previous immunotherapy and other types of immunotherapy to enroll.
      </p>
      <p>
If you have had prior immunotherapy, selecting 'allowed' will only show trials that do not exclude those that have received immunotherapy in the past. If you have not had immunotherapy, selecting 'show all trials' will show you all trials regardless of this exclusion criteria.
