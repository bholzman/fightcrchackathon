        New drugs or protocols must go through many phases to ensure safety before doctors can use it to treat patients. <strong>Phase I</strong> determines safe dosage range and identifies side effects. <strong>Phase II</strong> evaluates safety and effectiveness and <strong>Phase III</strong> confirms effectiveness, monitors side effects and compares the new treatment to treatment currently used. You can read more about the phasing in the FAQ section.
