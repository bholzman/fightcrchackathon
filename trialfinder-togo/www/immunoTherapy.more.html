Immunotherapy (IO) is an approach to cancer treatment that uses a person’s own immune system to fight diseases. Colorectal cancer (CRC) had been resistant to IO until recent research identified a subgroup of patients (MSI-H) who were receptive to certain IO treatments in a clinical trial. Now, clinical trials are investigating immunotherapy options for patients with Microsatellite Stable (MSS) tumors.

If you select “yes”, you will only be shown CRC Immunotherapy trials. If you select ”No”, you will be shown both immunotherapy and non-immunotherapy trials. These settings can be edited later in the Filter page.
