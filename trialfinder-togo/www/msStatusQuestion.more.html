        Currently the Fight CRC clinical trial finder only includes clinical trials that are for patients with late stage MSS, or Microsatellite stable, tumor types. With current immunotherapy approaches, MSS tumors have not had the same favorable responses as MSI, therefore research continues to study ways to effectively treat MSS tumors.

         Although this tool is only for late stage MSS patients, it’s very important to know your MSI status before making treatment decisions. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure of your tumor type.
